Gene expression data of lung cancer patients was analyzed with the k-means clustering technique. The data contained the expression data of 89 patients and 60607 genes which makes the data highly dimensional. After feature selection and cleaning the dataset was reduced to 78 patients and 28967 genes. Several dimension reduction methods were used to reduce the highly dimensional dataset. From the analysis we can conclude that t-SNE and NMF preserve the data more than the most commonly used PCA method[1]. The highest accuracy (~0.7) was achieved by using k-means on the weights of the NMF model.
